Django was utilized to provide a great Backend for our Web App
Django cors headers was used to have our Web API ready for a future Frontend Framework such as (React, Vue, Angular or HTMLX)
Django environ was used in this app to help provide security for sensitive data like: Database, Security Key or any other bits of data we need hidden.
Django Rest Framework was used in this project to provide a Rest API for our data to be able to be used or consumed.
